1) fabric fails to instatiate 20 and more endorsing peers on local machine, it might need to be instantiated manually to work properly
or just use less endorsing peer in tests.

2) iroha has timeouts when running benchmark with general node ./run......., the idea to overcome it is to start network manually and to test it
without start command in config file
3) iroha might fail to run some nodes, but it might be fixed with setting appropiate TIMEOUT in wait-for-it.sh file



BLOCK SIZE
1) fabric - change configuration and generate new genesis block
2) iroha - block size is in configs of peers, need to change it for all
